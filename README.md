# Lab: Permissions & PostgreSQL

## Overview

In this lab, we enhanced our site by adding permissions and switching to a PostgreSQL database, bringing it closer to production-grade.

## Features

### General

- Merge functionality from two demos:
  - Restrict access to portions of the API's data.
  - Switch to using PostgreSQL instead of SQLite.
- Customize your project to use different application features/models.

### Django REST Framework

- Convert your site to a DRF-powered API.
- Adjust project permissions to allow access only to authenticated users.
- Add custom permission for appropriate user actions.
